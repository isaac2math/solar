  - solar;
  - solar + hold out;
  - bsolar;
  - bolasso;

- the step-by-step demostration for bolasso, bsolar and solar;

  - Example 3 (Section 2.1);
  - Simulations 1, 2, 3 (Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.3);
  - Real-world application (Section 4);

### #1. Read this first carefully: package description

#### #1(a). Ananconda3

- solar, bsolar and hold-out average are developed on Ubuntu 20.04 using Anaconda3 version 2020-11. **We highly recommend using Anaconda3 since, by default, it satisfies all the dependencies (#2 below), relieving you from Python package management.**

#### #1(b). Coding style

In developing this package, we rigorously adhere to the following programming paradigm:

- **the comment-code ratio is larger than .** We only briefly list the file structure in #3 below (explaining the purpose of each file), since in each &quot;.py&quot; and &quot;.ipynb&quot; file we thoroughly explain

  - the meaning of every step;
  - the meaning of inputs and output;
  - the purpose of each function;
  - how each step corresponds to the paper.

- **the simulations and examples are in the &quot;.ipynb&quot; files; the &quot;.py&quot; files contain only the supporting functions for simulations and examples**.
- at the end of each &quot;.py&quot; file, we add a testing module for debugging. Simply run each &quot;.py&quot; file at your terminal. If no bugs are reported, the package is bug-free.
- The Python files automatically export the raw simulation/example results as &quot;.html&quot; files, which can be found in the &quot;./raw\_results&quot; folder; the numerical results are automatically saved as &quot;.p&quot; files in the &quot;numerical\_result&quot; subfolder of each simulation folder.

#### #1(c). Making the comparisons fair

**To ensure a fair sparsity/accuracy comparison between bsolar and bolasso (section 3.3),** we specifically code the simulation function &quot;simul\_plot\_parallel.py&quot; as follows:

- step 1: before simulation starts, reset the Numpy random seed to (aka the **father seed = 0** ).
- step 2: immediately after step 1,

  - use the father seed to generate **200 child seeds** via Numpy.
  - use each child seed to generate the data for one repetition in each scenario of Simulation 3, i.e., the child seed is used to generate the data in repetition for bsolar, solar and bolasso.

- Step 2 guarantees that, **even if you run Algorithm A and B in different files, Algorithm A and Algorithm B are evaluated on the same training/test/validation data in each repetition** , which is necessary for parallel or distributive computation.

**To ensure a fair runtime comparison between bsolar and bolasso** , we specifically code the competitors identically according to the following structure:

- step 1: compute the subsample selection frequency on the sample. Bsolar-3 trains 3 solar and bolasso trains 256 lasso.
- step 2: based on the subsample selection frequency of each variable, rank the variables in decreasing order.
- step 3: set the threshold (or 1) and select the variables with subsample selection frequencies larger than .
- To show that **the runtime difference is purely because we replace lasso with solar in a boostrap ensemble** ,

  - we **use the same code in steps 1 to 3** for bsolar and bolasso.
  - **the only difference** is that we use different algorithms (solar or lasso) to estimate subsample selection frequency in the for-loop of step 1.
  - we also **use the same parallel scheme (coded the same)** for bsolar and bolasso.
  - to address any claims that our parallel scheme is too aggressive, we also report **the runtime of bolasso using the default SciKit-learn parallel scheme, which is optimzed for the trainnig of lasso and, hence, bolasso.**

#### #1(d). Replication

- To replicate the simulations, **after you read though the detailed explanations and comments in each &quot;.ipynb&quot; file** , simply

  - pen each &quot;.ipynb&quot; file in Jupyter Lab,
  - click the &quot;Kernel&quot; menu
  - click &quot;Restart Kernel and Run All Cells&quot;.
  - **you may want to read the comments in &quot;.ipynb&quot; files carefully before you replicate 200-repetition bolasso simulations in Simulation 3 (since it could take very long time).**

- Python Package dependence: reported below in **#2.**
- Hardware settings: all the results are computed on a desktop with:

  - 8-core i9-9900K CPU;
  - CPU cooler: Corsair iCUE H150i ELITE CAPELLIX Liquid CPU Cooler, which prevents the CPU from thermal throttling by keeping CPU temperature below 65Â° Celsius at 100% load of each core.
  - 32 GB RAM;
  - GPU: _&quot;Asus GeForce RTX 3090 TUF Gaming&quot;_ for CUDA.

### #2. Package dependence

#### the package has been tested on Anaconda3 version 2020-11 and Ubuntu 20.04.1 with the following dependence:

- **Python 3.7.10** ;
- **scikit-learn 0.24.1** ;
- the C++ library **openBLAS** or, equivalently, **Intel MKL** ;

Note that

    - Intel MKL is known to be faster at matrix operations than openBLAS;
    - _2021/02/13: we found several openBLAS bugs on Apple M1 chips; there were no problems on AMD or Intel CPUs_.

- **numpy 1.19.2** or, equivalently, **jax.numpy** of **jax 0.2.10** ;

  - if you are working on large data (such as picture recognition, natural language processing or text mining with dimension ), the repeated bolasso simulations could take **days**. Hence, we strongly recommend

    - using **jax** for much quicker matrix operations in bolasso;
    - using **incomplete Cholesky decomposition** instead of the default one in Scikit-learn for bolasso.
    - if neither offer an improvement in bolasso runtime, reprogram your package using [**Numba**](http://numba.pydata.org/) **+** [**PyCuda**](https://developer.nvidia.com/pycuda) and run it with a **Nvidia GPU**. With Numba and PyCuda, the bsolar-3 runtime can be further reduced by a factor of around for .

- **jupyter 1.0.0** and **jupyterlab 3.0.11** ;
- **Matplotlib 3.3.4** ;

  - _2021/02/13: we disabled Plotly temporarily and use Matplotlib + Pandas instead; Plotly causes Javascript errors in Jupyter Lab and fails to show the graph/table when exporting ipyb files into html._

- **statsmodels 0.12.2** ;
- **tqdm 4.59.0** ;

  - _2021/02/13: among the runtime measure packages, tqdm takes the least runtime overhead (80ns) and guarantees the accuracy of runtime measurement._

- **joblib 1.0.1**.
