# define the class of solar #
#############################

'''
this class is used to demonstrate the performance comparison among solar, cv-lars-lasso and cv-cd

if you want the result of solar only, plz define 'lasso = False'

Check this before you run the code:
Plz check if you have 'sci-kit learn', 'numpy', 'matplotlib' and 'tqdm' installed. If not,
    1. run 'pip install scikit-learn numpy matplotlib tqdm' if you use pure Python3
    2. run 'conda install sci-kit learn numpy matplotlib tqdm' if you use Anaconda3

Modules:
    1. from scikit-learn, we call 'LassoLarsCV' and 'LassoCV' for cv-lars-lasso and cv-cd respectively;
    2. from scikit-learn, we call 'Lars' to compute solar.
    3. we use 'numpy' for matrix computation and random variable generation;
    4. for simulator and costcom, plz see 'simulator.py' and 'costcom.py' for detail;
    5. we use class 'time' to time the computation of solar

Inputs:
    1. X and y     : the inputs and output of regression
    2. sample_size : the total sample size we generate for cv-lars-lasso, cv-cd and solar
    3. n_dim       : the number of total variables in X
    4. n_info      : number of informative variables in data-generating process
    5. n_repeat    : the number of subsamples in solar
    6. step_size   : step size to tune the value of c for solar;
    7. rnd_seed    : the random seed for reproduction

Outputs:
    1. solar_coef   : the solar regression coefficients (defined at the end of Algorithm 3);
    2. opt_c        : value of c* in solar;
    3. test_error   : the list of test errors for tuning the value of c;
    4. Qc_list      : the nest sets of Q(c), for all value of c from 1 to 0;
    5. la_list      : number of variables selected by CV-lars-lasso;
    6. la_vari_list : the indices of variables selected by CV-lars-lasso;
    7. cd_list      : number of variables selected by CV-cd;
    8. cd_vari_list : the indices of variables selected by CV-cd;

Remarks:
    1. In each round of subsampling, we randomly take out 10% points out of the sample and make the rest as the subsample in this round
    2. In solar, we first take 20% points from the sample as test set, the remainder of which is called X_pretrain and Y_pretrian. We use X_pretrain and Y_pretrian to estimate the average solution path (Algorithm 2 in paper); we implement validation (not CV) on test set to finalize variable selection (Algorithm 3). As competitors, we use X and Y for LassoLarsCV (called CV-lars-lasso in paper) and LassoCV (called CV-cd in paper) estimation, which relies on 10-fold CV. The rest follows algo 2 and 3 in paper.

class solar:

    def __init__(self, X, Y, n_repeat, step_size, lasso = True):
    ##for convinience, we define the common variable (variables we need to use for each of the following functions) in the class as follows (the common variable is defined as self.xxxx)

        self.sample_size     = X.shape[0]  #sample size
        self.n_repeat        = n_repeat    #the number of subsamples generated in solar (10 in paper)

        self.subsample_size  = int(self.train_size  * 0.9) #the size of each subsample
        self.n_dim           = X.shape[1]  #the number of total variables in X
        self.lasso           = lasso #if lasso = true, this package will compute cv-lars-lasso and cv-cd alongside with solar for comparison

        self.X_test = X[int(-1*self.sample_size*0.2):,:]  #the observations of X in test set
        self.y_test = Y[int(-1*self.sample_size*0.2):,:]  #the observations of Y in test set
        self.X_so   = X[:int(-1*self.sample_size*0.2),:]  #the observations of X for average soluation path estimation
        self.y_so   = Y[:int(-1*self.sample_size*0.2),:]  #the observations of Y for average soluation path estimation

        self.X = X ; self.y = Y #the sample we generate via data-generating process

    def fit(self):

        ##1. construct a placeholder called 'qhat_k_container' for the list of all q_hat^k (defined in Algorithm 2) of each subsample
        qhat_k_container = list()

        ##2. estimate q_hat^k (for the solution path) on each subsample and save them as elements of the placeholder
        for j in range(self.n_repeat):

            #a. randomly choose a subset of sample points (whose index is 'index_subsample') that is used to generate a subsample in each repeat
            index_subsample = np.random.choice(self.train_size, self.subsample_size, replace=False)
            #b. based on 'index_subsample', take the corresponding observations of X out and save them as the subample
            X_subsample = self.X_so[index_subsample]
            #c. based on 'index_subsample', take the corresponding observations of Y out and save them as the subample
            y_subsample = self.y_so[index_subsample]

            #d. scikit-learn requires 'y_subsample' to be an one-dimension array
            y_subsample.shape = (y_subsample.shape[0],)

            #e. given a subsample, compute q_hat^k (the solution path) using lars

            #e(1). call the class 'Lars'
            trial_1 = Lars(n_nonzero_coefs=min(X_subsample.shape[1] + 1, X_subsample.shape[0] + 1))
            #e(2). fit lars on the subsample
            trial_1.fit(X_subsample, y_subsample)
            #e(3). save the active set of lars (indices of variables select by lars) as 'active'.
            active  = trial_1.active_

            #f. The active set of lars is ranked based on the chronology of variable inclusion at different stages of lars. For example [2,1,3] means x_2 is included at stage 1, x_1 is included at stage 2 and x_3 is included at stage 3. Based on the active set of lars, we compute q_hat^k (defined as 'qhat_k' in code) as defined in Algorithm 2

            #f(1). we generate 'qhat_k' as an array of zeros;
            qhat_k = np.zeros((1,self.n_dim))
            #f(2). we compute the i-th value of q_hat^k for the corresponding variable based on Algorithm 2; replace i-th term in 'qhat_k' with the value we just compute
            for i in active:

                qhat_k[0,i] = 1 - (np.where(np.array(active)==i)[0][0])/(self.n_dim)

            #f(3). we append the result into 'qhat_k_container' as one element of the list
            qhat_k_container.append(qhat_k)

        ##3. if self.lasso == True, we compute CV-lars-lasso and CV-cd on the original sample X and Y (not on the subsample)
        if (self.lasso == True):

            #a(1). call the class for CV-lars-lasso (called LassoLarsCV in Scikit-learn)

            la_vari_list = trial_2.active_

            #f. call the class for CV-cd (called LassoCV in Scikit-learn)
            #f(1). we set the number of folds in CV as 10
            #f(2). for reproduction, we fix the random seed of training-validation split in CV (random_state=0)
            trial_3 = LassoCV(cv=10, random_state=0)

            #g.  fit cv-cd on X and Y
            trial_3.fit(self.X, yy)

            cd_vari_list = np.nonzero(trial_3.coef_)[0]

        ##4. compute q_hat and Q(c) (defined in Algorithm 2)
        #a(1). we transform the list of all q_hat^k ('qhat_k_container') into a matrix ('qhat_k_container_matrix')
        #a(2). row of the matrix: the q_hat^k on a given subsample for all variables
        #a(3). colum of the matrix: the corresponding value of q_hat^k for a given variable on all subsamples
        qhat_k_container_matrix = np.concatenate(qhat_k_container, axis = 0)
        #b.  compute the the value of qhat for each variable (qhat defined in Algorithm 2 of the paper)
        qhat_value = np.mean(qhat_k_container_matrix, axis = 0)

        #c. set 'Qc_list' as the container of Q(c) for all value of c
        Qc_list = list()
        #d. set 'c_seq' as the sequence of c for the grid search of c* in solar
        c_seq = np.arange(max(qhat_value), 0.1, self.step_size)

        #e. generate Q(c) for each value of c
        for j in c_seq:
            #e(1). define 'container' as the placeholder of Q(c) when c == j;
            container = list()

            for i in range( self.X.shape[1] ):
                #e(2). include all variables into 'container' if their corresponding values in q-hat are larger or equal to j;
                if (qhat_value[i] >= j):

                    container.append(i)
            #e(3). append 'container' (Q(c) when c == j) into 'Qc_list' (the container of Q(c) for all value of c);
            Qc_list.append(container)

        ##5. compute the test error of each value of c
        #we use grid search on test set to choose c*;
        #for each value of c in the grid search, train a OLS of Y_so on the variables of Q(c) in X_so (Y_so and X_so defined at the begining);

        #a. container for test errors
        test_error = list()

        #b. compute the test error of each Q(c) on test set
        #b(0). set i as the indices of all variables in Q(c) for a given value of c;

            #b(2). compute OLS of Y_so on the variables in Q(c) in X_so;
            OLS_1.fit(self.X_so[ :, i], self.y_so)

            s1 = costs_com(self.X_test[:,i], self.y_test, OLS_1)
            loss_test_1 ,_ = s1.L2()
            #b(4). save the L2 error as the test error of Q(c) for each value of c; append it into the container of test errors;
            test_error.append(loss_test_1)


        ##6. tuning c via grid search
        #6(a). transform 'test_error' from a list into an array;
        test_error = np.asarray(test_error)
        #6(b). save the location of minimum of 'test_error' as 'min_loc_val';
        min_loc_val = np.where(test_error == min(test_error))[0]
        #6(c). save the correpsonding value of c (c*) as 'opt_c';
        opt_c = c_seq[min_loc_val]
        #6(d). find Q(c*) and save it as 'Q_opt_c';
        Q_opt_c = Qc_list[max(min_loc_val)]

        ##7. Regression of Y onto the selected variables ( Q(c*) ) in X
        #7(a). call the LinearRegression class;

        solar_coef = np.zeros([self.n_dim,1])
        #7(d). put the estimated regression coefficents into their corresponding place of 'solar_coef'
        solar_coef[Q_opt_c,0] = OLS_2.coef_

        ##8. define la_list, la_vari_list as empty list if self.lasso != True (if we don't want to compute cv-lars-lasso and cv-cd)
